# TriviaGame

https://mrhopkins.github.io/TriviaGame/

In this assignment, I created a horror movie trivia game that presents the user with 15 multiple choice questions. The user has 15 seconds to answer each question. Once anaswered or when time runs out, the answer and a gif related to the answer will display for a few seconds before moving on the the next question. Your final score is displayed at the end of the game.
